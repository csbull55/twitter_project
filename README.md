# reddit_bot
This project will be learning about making a reddit bot and deploying it both an rpi3 and a ec2 instance.

## Goal
The general use of the bot will be to run on a schedule and grab post/comment data from a list of subs. I plan on using relatively small subs to narrow the amount of data collected. Might create some sort of dashboard type analysis to monitor the data collected over the last week. Make it reply to comment when asked, return info requested

### To do's:
* Learn reddit api
* determine data to be collected
* write bot
* set up docker container
* set up some sort of monitoring system

## Current Bots
Each of these bots have similar functionality, but complete it doing different methods
The current version of the bot is the reddit_bot_mention.
