# twitter_project
This project will initially be for grabbing twitter data for a few accounts and storing them in a local database. After I've collected a sufficient amount of data (1 month), I'll start to build out the analysis portion of the project

## Goal
To learn how to interact with twitter's api, learn how to building the integration between an api and local database, and to eventually use the tweets to conduct some basic analysis

### To do's:
* Learn twitter api
* Explore python libraries for working with twitter data
* determine which accounts, and what info to store (going to collect more than I think I need
* set up database (PostgreSQL)
* build app to pull from api into database and to which tables
* explore scheduling options
  * twitter offers 7 days tweet history for free, worst case scenario I could just manually run it once a week to collect
  the info. Ideally I'd like to explore hosting it somewhere, either online or set up a server locally (have an old PC I could
  use)
* After data is collected, work on analysis portion. Will set it up to be automatic, maybe explore creating custom dashboards
using python
